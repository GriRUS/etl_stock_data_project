# etl_stock_data_project
ETL project on retail stock data 

Short description:
I've implemented ETL process to analyse stock data of 5 FMCG companies from the USA and Russia. 

The whole pipeline can be described as follows:
API --> Python transformation --> Postgres DB --> SQL Aggregations --> Tableau Dashboard

Ultimate goal:
Develop ETL skills and enrich BI-expertise.
